<p>So many confusing terms huh!! Let me explain these one by one</p>

<h3 id="what-is-object-detection">What is Object Detection</h3>

<p>We humans have ability to watch and identify things. For example, consider this image</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/kavysabu1996/assets/images/DETR/fig1.png" alt="Image" style="max-width:400px;" />
</div>

<div style="text-align:center">
    <a href="https://stock.adobe.com/in/search?k=dog+cat+and+bird&amp;asset_id=81951964">image source</a>
</div>

<p>You can identify each object by simply looking at it. Left most is dog, cat at the center, and a bird. But what about machines?<br /> 
Humans’ve developed techniques for machines to identify and locate things known as Object Detection. In object detection machine detects the presence of object, localize it through drawing bounding boxes and identify the class of the object. An exaple is give below. Don’t confuse it with image classification. In classification problems the task of machine is to identify class of the given object, there is no need of localization.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/kavysabu1996/assets/images/DETR/fig1_box.png" alt="Image" style="max-width:400px;" />
</div>

<div style="text-align:center">
    output of DETR
</div>

<p>Now you have idea about Object Detection. Let’s then talk about the specialities of DETR mentioned earlier. <br />
DIrect set prediction directly predicts the object class labels and their corresponding bounding boxes in a single step. It treats object detection as a regression problem, where the netowk direcly output the coordinates and class probabilities for each object.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[DETR aka DEtection TRansformer is a state-of-art algorithm proposed by Meta(formerly known as FaceBook) in 2020.

<p><strong>What exactly is the concept of diffusion in deep learning?</strong> <br />
The process of progressively adding noise to an image is commonly referred to as ‘diffusion’ in the context of deep learning. A deep learning model that utilizes the diffusion process to model the probability distribution of a dataset is commonly referred to as a diffusion model. The diffusion process involves adding progressively more noise to the data to smooth it out, and the model is trained to invert this process by generating a sample from the probability distribution represented by the diffusion process.</p>

<p>The two main processes involved are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>forward diffusion : add noise to the image</li>
  <li>reverse diffusion : remove noise from the image</li>
</ol>

<p>Diffusion models require significant computational resources. To deal with this issue “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10752.pdf">High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models</a>” introduced latent diffusion models (LDMs). Here, we utilize encoders to reduce the data into a low-dimensional latent space, and then perform the diffusion process on the reduced data. As the resule, both forward and backward diffusions take place in the latent space. Consequently, this approach can significantly reduce the computational cost.</p>

<p>We can rewrite the primary process in Latent Diffusion Models as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>forward diffusion : add noise to data in latent space</li>
  <li>reverse diffusion : remove noise from data in latent space</li>
</ol>
